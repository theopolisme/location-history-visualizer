# location-history-visualizer

**Available online: [locationhistoryvisualizer.com/heatmap/](https://locationhistoryvisualizer.com/heatmap/)**

A tool for visualizing your complete, consolidated, collected Google [Location History](https://google.com/locationhistory).

It works directly in your web browser &ndash; no software to download, no packages to install. **Everyone deserves to know what data is being collected about them, without having to fiddle with cryptic pieces of software.**

*location-history-visualizer* takes raw Google Takeout output and produces a heatmap of all of your location data over time, overlaid on an interactive map.

## Packages used
* [leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/), for rendering the interactive map
* [leaflet.heat](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.heat), for rendering the heatmap overlay
* [filestream](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/filestream), for dealing with gigantic Google Takeout files
* [oboe.js](http://oboejs.com), for processing said gigantic files
* [browserify](http://browserify.org/), for helping filestream  work properly in the browser
